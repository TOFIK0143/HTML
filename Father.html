        <span style="color: aquamarine;">Few Words about him :</span>

            <p> 
            He is a very hardworking and honest man I ever meet in my <b>life</b>
            He is my first inspiration, his honesty inspires me a lot, in his life he just want a peace and hapiness.
            <br/>He has teaches many students and make them <i>successfull </i>and till now doing same.
            <br/>These just few lines which I got in my mind to write but he has many qualities to tell for that my word will not be enough.
           <br/>I can tell your first hero and role model should be your father.</p>
